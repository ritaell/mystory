---SO HERE IS A "DIARY" WHERE I UPDATE MY PROCCESS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE---

#My Journey into the World of IT
##ðŸš€ The Beginning: A Spark of Interest
It all started when I was 10. Our school introduced us to Scratch, a visual programming language designed for beginners. The excitement of turning my ideas into interactive games and short films was overwhelming. My teacher noticed my enthusiasm and creativity, encouraging me to explore further by watching YouTube tutorials.

##ðŸŽ“ The First Steps: Discovering Programming
With new knowledge at my fingertips, I dove deeper into programming. I quickly learned to develop complete games from scratch(the programming lanuage) and proudly published them. This initial exploration laid the foundation for my journey into the vast world of programming. I also did robotics from the age of 10 until 12 where I had an amazing teacher and i was taught basic programming logic using the EV3 robotics kit.

##ðŸ¦  A Turning Point: Quarantine and New Inspirations
During the COVID-19 quarantine, I discovered the series "Mr. Robot" on Netflix. The protagonist, Elliot, inspired me with his cybersecurity skills. I wanted to learn hacking to protect against cybercriminals. However, I learned the wrong way; I downloaded random tools from GitHub and used them without understanding how they work.

##ðŸ“š Back to Basics: Building a Solid Foundation
Realizing the need for a strong foundation, I went back to basics. At 11, I started learning HTML and web development. This was a pivotal moment, as it helped me realize my passion for programming and confirmed my desire to pursue a career in IT.

##ðŸ§  Growing Knowledge: Expanding Horizons
By the age of 12-14, I took two web development courses and a game devloping, which solidified my understanding and skills.

 At 14, my interests expanded to data analysis, and I began learning Python through a mobile app.

##ðŸ“ˆ Current Focus: Python, Cybersecurity, and Data Analysis
Now, almost 15, I am immersed in CS50's Introduction to Python course. I plan to further my knowledge with CS50x, CS50's Cybersecurity course, and an AI course. While web development introduced me to IT, I have found my true interests lie in cybersecurity and data analysis.
update:i took cs50p
